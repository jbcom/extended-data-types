# Product Overview

Extended Data Types is a Python utility library that provides enhanced functionality for working with common data formats and types. It serves as a reliable, typed utility layer for Python applications that need to handle serialization, file operations, and data transformations.

## Core Purpose

- **Serialization utilities**: Safe, typed helpers for YAML, JSON, TOML, HCL, and Base64 encoding/decoding
- **File system operations**: Platform-aware file path handling, Git repository discovery, and encoding detection
- **Data structure manipulation**: Enhanced list and dictionary operations including flattening, filtering, and merging
- **String transformations**: Case conversion, humanization, pluralization, and validation utilities
- **Type utilities**: Safe type conversion and validation with proper error handling

## Key Design Principles

- **Type safety**: Full type annotations and mypy compliance
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive test coverage with automated CI/CD
- **Ergonomics**: Clean, intuitive APIs that don't sacrifice readability
- **Platform awareness**: Handles cross-platform differences gracefully
- **Production ready**: No shortcuts, placeholders, or experimental features

## Target Users

Developers building Python applications that need robust data handling capabilities, particularly those working with configuration files, data pipelines, or multi-format serialization workflows.
